I need to figure out how to add a table on to the admin side and have it be organized. 

I'll send you to organize the do_settings to have it be linked to a valid call back.

The file product-placer-simple/admin/partials/ppssettingscallbacks.php shouldn't be called exactly that 
even though it is used as a callback.
