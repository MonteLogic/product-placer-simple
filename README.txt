I have a view of a button as of early 09/02/2021, however it is not being displayed from a strict php function like I did with MHO, I think this is 
fine, I simply have to rewrite/refactor it. 

Also, it is being displayed in real html with syntax higlighting which is good, I still have yet to find out how I am going to use 
logic like get_option for this input possibly it will be done with dropping in and out of php.
